                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the need to stay organized and productive in an ever-busy world. The idea came from a personal struggle with task management, where using existing tools felt too complex or overwhelming for simple day-to-day needs. <br><br>
                    The goal was to create a streamlined, no-nonsense task management app that would allow anyone to focus on what matters mostâ€”getting things done. This project has been developed over several weeks and is part of the ALXSE Portfolio Project.
